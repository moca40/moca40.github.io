Edwin Wong, son of MOCA Journey Wall supporter Thomas Wong and president of the Forest Hills Asian Association, decided to show support for first responders that were working to save lives on Easter Sunday. Wong grew up in a Christian household and wanted to honor the memory of his recently deceased parents by donating tubs of ice cream from Chinatown Ice Cream Factory to several FDNY EMS stations in Woodside, Elmhurst, and Far Rockaway. The stations he chose were ones close to his parentâ€™s home in Maspeth and had previously resuscitated his father. He also encouraged members of the community to donate to the EMS FDNY help fund. While some of us may not have the capability to facilitate massive donations of PPE, even little things can show our appreciation for frontline and essential workers.
