Professor [Ngoc Cindy Pham](https://youtu.be/A-9TKYvTxCM) of Brooklyn College, who is of Chinese and Vietnamese descent, has really taken the reins during the onset of the Covid-19 crisis. She started a GoFundMe for Brooklyn Collegeâ€™s Class of 2020, which will pay for a delayed celebration of their graduation once they are able to come back to campus. In addition, she has been offering aid in all sorts of ways to members of her community and her students, including providing mental and emotional support for friends and students as well as donating homemade dumplings for those struggling to make ends meet. She proudly explains that her dumplings, which were a recipe passed down  through her Chinese lineage, were well-received.
