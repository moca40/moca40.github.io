In light of the anti-Asian racism brought about due to Covid-19, New Yorker Barbara Yau feared for the safety of her 14-year-old daughter Kyra. Rather than fall into patterns of anxiety and anger, the two thought about ways that they could help inform and hopefully alleviate some of the negative sentiments toward Asians. As a donation to MOCA’s OneWorld Collection, Barbara and Krya have submitted a poster that [Kyra](https://www.instagram.com/skye_artemis/) created to deter the acts of racism and inform victims on how to report such incidents. Kyra’s poster features the graphic of a girl in a mask and declares in red “I am Asian but I am NOT a virus,” giving information in both English and Chinese. Barbara has been in contact with local politicians, community leaders, and business owners about putting these posters up in the community.
