David Youtz, President of the [Yale-China Association](https://www.yalechina.org/covid19-assistance), has been active in efforts to fight Covid-19 through orchestrating donations of much-needed medical gear. There have already been several rounds of PPE donations, as the Yale-China Association works with different organizations and institutions in China to source donations. The latest batch of donations per the time of his [submission](https://www.newhavenbiz.com/article/yale-med-school-receives-n95-masks-from-chinese-ngos) is a shipment of 23,000 N95 masks sent to the Yale New Haven Hospital, sourced through a group of China-based NGOs calling themselves the “Covid-19 Preservation Fund.” His submission included a heartfelt letter from a student of the Yali High School in China expressing his feelings towards sending aid overseas.
